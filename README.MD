It checks your `package-lock.json` dependencies for repeated instances
of modules.

## Usage

1)Change to your project directory: `cd /your/project/dir`;

2)Check that you have `package-lock.json` there;

3)Run `npx wtfwith moduleName` or `npx wtfwith everything`!

4)Enjoy!

## More options

You can use any module name, or my favorite command:
`npx wtfwith everything`!
